2. **Color Tokens**: CSS variables for consistent theming
3. **Spacing System**: Standardized spacing tokens
4. **Border Radius**: Consistent curve patterns
5. **Shadows**: Apple-inspired layered shadows

- Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Collapsible sidebar for space efficiency

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels throughout
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Screen reader compatibility

## Backend Architecture Differences

### Current Site
- Direct webhook calls to N8N
- No local state management
- Simple localStorage for conversations
- No user authentication system

### Static Site
- Component-based state management
- Complex routing with hash navigation
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Mock API interactions for demos

## Integration Opportunities

### High Priority
1. **Guided Prompt Chips**: Easy win for user engagement
   - Can be added to current InputArea component
   - Minimal code changes required
   
2. **Animated Intro**: Brand enhancement
   - Can be conditionally shown on first visit
   - Adds professional polish

3. **Search Results Display**: Better document presentation
   - Replace current simple text responses
   - Add confidence scoring and highlighting

### Medium Priority
1. **Onboarding System**: Improve user activation
   - Requires state management updates
   - Would need adaptation for current architecture

2. **HandoverExportModal**: Lead generation
   - Requires backend endpoint for email capture
   - PDF generation capability needed

3. **InstallCTA**: Conversion optimization
   - Needs tracking system for triggers
   - Calendar booking integration required

### Low Priority (Requires Major Refactor)
1. **Full TypeScript Migration**: Code quality improvement
2. **Vite Build System**: Performance optimization
3. **Radix UI Components**: Comprehensive UI upgrade

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### For Current Site Integration
1. **Component Extraction**: Most new components are self-contained
2. **Style Adaptation**: Need to extract CSS-in-JS to inline styles
3. **State Management**: Convert React hooks to vanilla JS
4. **Event Handling**: Adapt React synthetic events to DOM events

### Dependencies to Add
- Motion library for animations (optional)
- Email validation library for forms
- PDF generation library for exports

## Performance Impact
- New components are lightweight
- Animations use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Lazy loading patterns for modals
- Minimal bundle size increase

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
1. Add GuidedPromptChips to input area
2. Implement AnimatedIntro on first visit
3. Style existing components with new design tokens

### Phase 2 (Enhanced Features)
1. Add SearchResults component for better responses
2. Implement basic onboarding tooltips
3. Add confidence scoring to AI responses

### Phase 3 (Full Integration)
1. Migrate to TypeScript gradually
2. Implement full onboarding system
3. Add conversion tracking and CTAs

## Conclusion
The static site represents a significant evolution in UI/UX sophistication while maintaining the core yacht AI functionality. The modular architecture allows for selective feature adoption without requiring a complete rewrite. Priority should be given to user-facing improvements that enhance engagement and conversion metrics.
