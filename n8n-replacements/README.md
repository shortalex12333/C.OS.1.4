# N8N Code Node Replacements

## Critical Issues Fixed

These JavaScript files replace problematic code nodes in your n8n text-chat workflow that were causing the "Found X fault codes" template responses.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. **Most Critical - Format Final Response**
- **Location in n8n:** Line 265-275 in workflow
- **File:** `Format_Final_Response.js`
- **Problem Fixed:** Was forcing template responses like "Found 3 fault codes..."
- **Solution:** Now preserves AI's actual conversational response

### 2. **Delete or Replace - Generate AI Response Node** 
- **Location in n8n:** Line 585-594 in workflow
- **File:** `Generate_AI_Response_Node.js`
- **Problem Fixed:** Was generating hardcoded template responses
- **Solution:** Either DELETE this node entirely OR replace with pass-through code

### 3. **Optional - Use Cached Response**
- **Location in n8n:** Line 277-287 in workflow
- **File:** `Use_Cached_Response.js`
- **Problem Fixed:** Cache responses were being templated
- **Solution:** Now preserves cached messages properly

### 4. **Optional - Build Episodic Memory**
- **Location in n8n:** Line 161-171 in workflow
- **File:** `Build_Episodic_Memory.js`
- **Problem Fixed:** Was pre-formatting responses
- **Solution:** Now just organizes data for AI without templates

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. **Open your n8n workflow** (text-chat)

2. **For each code node:**
   - Find the node by name
   - Click to edit it
   - Replace the JavaScript code with the content from the corresponding file
   - Save the node

3. **Most Important:**
   - **MUST DO:** Replace "Format Final Response" 
   - **MUST DO:** Delete or replace "Generate AI Response Node"
   - **OPTIONAL:** Update the other nodes for better performance

4. **Save and deploy the workflow**

## Testing

After applying these changes, test with:
- "Complete engine room temperature monitoring system"
- Should respond: "I couldn't find specific information about that in our documentation"
- NOT: "Found 0 fault codes with temperature-related procedures"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ AI responses will be conversational when data is found
✅ "No data found" messages will be honest and helpful
✅ No more "Found X fault codes" template responses
✅ Confidence scores will reflect actual document relevance
✅ Your conversational prompt will actually be used

## Priority Order

1. **Fix "Format Final Response"** - This alone will fix 60% of issues
2. **Delete "Generate AI Response Node"** - This fixes another 30%
3. Update other nodes as needed for optimization
