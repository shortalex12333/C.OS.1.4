# Backups

Backup versions of modified components.

## Contents

- `Login.backup.tsx` - Original Login component before glassmorphism upgrade
- `SignUp.backup.tsx` - Original SignUp component before UI redesign

## Purpose

These backups preserve the original component implementations before major UI upgrades. They can be referenced if you need to:

- Revert changes
- Compare implementations
- Extract specific functionality from original versions

## Note

These files are not included in the production build and are kept for reference only.
