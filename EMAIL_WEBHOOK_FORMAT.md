## Required Fields for Email Solutions

### Core Email Metadata (ALL REQUIRED)
```typescript
{
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier "email_001"
  solution_id: string;           // Same as id for consistency  
  company: string;               // "MTU Engines", "Caterpillar Marine" 
  sender: string;                // "Mark Thompson", "Carlos Alvarez"
  receiver: string;              // "Engineering Team", "Chief Engineer"
  date_sent: string;             // "Aug 27, 2025" (human readable)
  subject_line: string;          // Email subject line
  body_text: string;             // Full email body content
  ai_summary: string;            // AI-generated summary of email relevance
  thread_count: number;          // Number of replies (0 if no thread)
}
```

### Optional Fields
```typescript
{
  profile_picture?: string;      // URL to profile image (null if none)
  attachment_name?: string;      // "file.pdf", "document.xlsx" 
  attachment_icon_type?: string; // "pdf", "xlsx", "zip", "jpg", etc.
  email_url?: string;           // Link to full email view
}
```

### Confidence Fields (REQUIRED - Same as Solution Cards)
```typescript
{
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low";  // String confidence level
  confidenceScore: number;                 // 0-100 percentage for circle color
}
```

## Response Metadata (REQUIRED)
```typescript
{
  "search_strategy": "email" | "email-yacht",  // CRITICAL: Triggers EmailSolutionCard
  "confidence_calculation": "from_emails",
  "documents_searched": number
}
```

## Attachment Icon Types
- **pdf**: üìÑ
- **doc/docx**: üìù  
- **xls/xlsx**: üìä
- **zip**: üì¶
- **jpg/png**: üì∏
- **default**: üìé

## Critical Requirements

1. **Array Wrapper**: Response MUST be wrapped in array `[{...}]`
2. **Search Strategy**: `metadata.search_strategy` MUST be `"email"` or `"email-yacht"`
3. **Portrait Layout**: Email cards use 380px max width (portrait orientation)
4. **Thread Count**: Always include `thread_count` (use 0 if no replies)
5. **AI Summary**: Required field explaining email relevance to query
6. **Company Field**: Required for proper sender identification
7. **Date Format**: Human-readable format "Aug 27, 2025" preferred over ISO

## Email vs Technical Solution Differences

**Email Solutions Focus On:**
- Communication metadata (sender, company, thread context)
- Email content (subject, body, attachments)  
- Correspondence relevance (AI summary of email value)

**Technical Solutions Focus On:**
- Diagnostic procedures (steps, parts, time estimates)
- Equipment specifications (pressures, temperatures, torque)
- Safety warnings and technical documentation

## Webhook Processing Flow

1. **Request**: Contains `search_strategy: 'email'`
2. **Processing**: Search email database for relevant correspondence  
3. **Response**: Return array with email solution format
4. **Frontend**: Detects `search_strategy === 'email'` ‚Üí renders `EmailSolutionCard`
5. **Display**: Portrait cards show email metadata + content preview
